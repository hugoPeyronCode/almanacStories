  <h1>Bio</h1>

  <p>Hugo Peyron is a product builder, developer, and designer. He joined <a href="https://www.voodoo.io">Voodoo</a> in 2016, where he co-founded the publishing department during the hyper-casual era. Over several years, he worked with more than 200 mobile game studios worldwide, and the games he signed generated over 400 million downloads.</p>

  <p>He later moved into product management and studio building. He is the founder of <a href="https://www.voodoo.io">Cortex</a>, a Voodoo-backed studio, where he focuses on building high-scale mobile products without lowering the bar on taste or depth. Rather than shipping isolated features, he builds systems designed to compound over time.</p>

  <p>He is currently building <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/the-almanac">The Almanac</a>, a daily puzzle game exploring how depth, taste, and long-term thinking can survive at mobile scale.</p>

  <p>He writes to sharpen his thinking and to understand, over time, what actually makes products last.</p>
