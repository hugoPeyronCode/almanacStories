  <h1>Context</h1>

  <p>I spent ten years in mobile gaming, working with hundreds of studios and shipping products that reached hundreds of millions of players. The industry taught me that volume is everything. Volume of ideas, of prototypes, of iterations. Speed wins. The teams that shipped the most learned the fastest, and the ones that learned the fastest dominated.</p>

  <p>Then I decided to do the opposite.</p>

  <p>After a decade of fast prototyping with other people's teams, I wanted to build one product with my own. Something that treats users as intelligent by default. Something that earns attention rather than captures it.</p>

  <p>I'm drawn to product design because, like most disciplines when pursued deeply enough, it touches everything else. Psychology, aesthetics, economics, even biology. The deeper you go, the more connections you find.</p>

  <p>My current project is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/the-almanac">The Almanac</a>, a daily puzzle game that contradicts almost everything I learned building hit games. It's hard. The UI is pastel. The experience is deliberately slow in places. It's not designed to please everyone. It's not quite a game and not quite an app. It explores whether rituals, difficulty curves, and careful pacing can support depth in an industry that usually optimizes it away.</p>

  <p>This blog exists to sharpen my thinking and document decisions in public. The goal is not to be right, but to understand what actually makes products last.</p>
