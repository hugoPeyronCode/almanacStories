  <h1>Context</h1>

  <p>Systemic Thinking is written by a product builder with a background in mobile games, product development, and design. The author spent several years operating at scale in the mobile gaming industry, working with hundreds of studios worldwide and contributing to products that reached hundreds of millions of players.</p>

  <p>After working in high-velocity environments optimized for short-term performance, the focus shifted toward product management and studio building, with an emphasis on systems rather than features. The work centers on designing products that compound over time, without lowering the bar on taste, depth, or craft.</p>

  <p>The current project is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/the-almanac">The Almanac</a>, a daily puzzle game built as an experiment in long-term thinking at mobile scale. It explores how rituals, difficulty curves, content pacing, and design systems can support depth in an industry often driven by speed and optimization.</p>

  <p>This blog exists to sharpen thinking, document decisions in public, and revisit assumptions over time. The goal is not to be right, but to understand what actually makes products last.</p>
