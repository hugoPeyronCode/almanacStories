    <h1>Most Designers Are Not System Builders</h1>
    <p class="date">December 2025</p>

    <p>Most designers are not system builders, good ones are.</p>

    <p>When I started building digital products, designers had more power than developers. They worked hand in hand with PMs. Developers were executants. They received polished Figma files and built what they were told.</p>

    <p>Something always felt off.</p>

    <p>Most designers I worked with were artists. Sharp eye for beauty, for balance, for polish. But weak on systems. Weak on logic. They could make something look right without understanding why it worked—or whether it would work at all once built.</p>

    <p>In my career, I've met two exceptional designers: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-tuil-5a242b48/">Anthony Tuil</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-bourdier-26a89327/">Alexandre Bourdier</a>. Anthony is a former engineer. Bourdier—on whom I might write more later—might have been the best hyper-casual game designer of the 21st century.</p>

    <p>What they had in common: they did what other designers don't.</p>

    <p>They benchmarked constantly. They thought about jobs to be done, not just aesthetics. They asked what value we were actually delivering. They worked close to their developers. They involved them in system building. They operated in pairs: the artist with the vision, the engineer who actually builds the thing.</p>

    <p>They understood something most designers never do: the developer builds the product. The app on the store is what counts. Not the Figma.</p>

    <p>That's what I've implemented at Cortex. Six people. Four developers. One designer. One PM. As I described in <a href="pm-directs.html">PM Directs, Dev Owns, Designer Polishes</a>: I set direction and build the roadmap. Each developer owns their feature—they write the spec, improve it, draft their own wireframes, and present to the lead dev and me. Only after careful validation does the designer come in for final polish.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a good idea emerges at that last step. But involving the designer too early tends to introduce chaos into the system we're trying to build.</p>

    <p>Beautiful design is, first, a beautiful system.</p>
