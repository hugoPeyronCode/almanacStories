    <h1>The Fear is Not New. The Speed Is.</h1>
    <p class="date">December 2025</p>

    <h2>Has humanity feared technological unemployment before?</h2>

    <p>Yes, repeatedly.</p>

    <p><strong>1811–1816.</strong> English Luddites destroy textile looms. Parliament responds with the Frame Breaking Act (1812), making machine destruction punishable by death.</p>

    <p><strong>1831–1834.</strong> Canuts revolt in Lyon against Jacquard looms. 600 dead. Army intervention required.</p>

    <p><strong>1890s.</strong> Electricity eliminates entire professions. New York counted 1,000 lamplighters in 1880. Zero by 1920.</p>

    <p><strong>1930.</strong> Keynes predicts a 15-hour workweek by 2030 due to automation.</p>

    <p><strong>1961.</strong> TIME Magazine runs the cover story "Automation: Will It Kill Jobs?" Economist Wassily Leontief compares workers to horses made obsolete by cars. For context: the US horse population dropped from 26 million in 1915 to 3 million in 1960.</p>

    <p><strong>1995.</strong> Jeremy Rifkin publishes <em>The End of Work</em>, predicting mass technological unemployment.</p>

    <p>Each time the pattern repeated: destruction, then creation, then adaptation. The US agricultural workforce went from 40% in 1900 to 2% in 2000. No permanent mass unemployment followed.</p>

    <h2>Is AI different this time?</h2>

    <p><strong>Arguments for "yes."</strong> AI targets cognitive work, the very refuge displaced workers were told to flee toward. Goldman Sachs estimated in 2023 that 300 million jobs are exposed globally. The speed is unprecedented. GPT-3 to GPT-4 took 18 months. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in 2 months. TikTok needed 9 months for the same milestone. AI substitutes rather than augments. A mechanical loom still needed an operator. In 2024, Klarna replaced 700 customer service agents with AI. IBM paused hiring for 7,800 back-office roles.</p>

    <p><strong>Arguments for "no."</strong> New jobs always emerge unpredictably. "App developer" did not exist before 2008. Today, the US counts over 2 million of them. AI still hallucinates. GPT-4 shows a 15–20% error rate on factual tasks. Human oversight remains necessary. Every catastrophic prediction has been wrong. US unemployment in 2024 hovers around 4%, near historic lows, despite decades of automation.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The difference is not necessarily more job destruction. It is faster destruction, hitting people who believed they were safe.</p>

    <p>The economic challenge is less about total volume than about the brutality of the transition and society's capacity to retrain at AI speed.</p>
