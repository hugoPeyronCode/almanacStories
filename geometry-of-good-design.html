    <h1>The Geometry of Good Design</h1>
    <p class="date">December 2025</p>

    <p>There's a persistent myth about design: that great work emerges from singular vision. One brilliant mind, fully formed ideas, the rest of the team executing. It makes for good storytelling. It's also mostly wrong.</p>

    <p>Good design is a multitude of small choices and back-and-forth exchanges. Micro-adjustments that compound. The interesting question isn't whether collaboration matters—it clearly does—but how many people it takes to do it well. There's a geometry to this. Get the shape wrong and the process breaks down.</p>

    <h2>The Problem With One</h2>

    <p>Alone, you lack perspective. You can persevere in a wrong direction for too long—sometimes all the way to the end—convinced you're right because no one told you otherwise. Or the opposite happens: you drift in too many directions at once, chasing every new idea, never converging.</p>

    <p>Others help you focus. They're the guardrails that keep you on the road.</p>

    <h2>The Ideal Is Two</h2>

    <p>A duo of creatives, especially if they're complementary, is the sweet spot.</p>

    <p>This is my situation with my lead developer and co-founder at Cortex. He tends to hyper-simplify. I tend to add too much. We regularly arrive at a good middle ground. Neither of us would get there alone. The tension between our instincts is productive.</p>

    <p>Two people can move fast. Decisions happen in real-time. There's no waiting for alignment meetings or consensus-building. You talk, you disagree, you resolve, you move.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Two</h2>

    <p>Once you're past two, the dynamics shift. You need genuine trust and comfort with changing rhythms. Some phases will be fast, others slow. People need to accept that.</p>

    <p>In practice, most interactions still happen in pairs. What you get with three or four people is a rotation of complementary duos working on the same problem from different angles. The larger group reconvenes to synthesize.</p>

    <p>Being more than two helps identify the obvious. When three out of four people are certain about a decision, the decision is settled. This can be a problem in a duo, where a single disagreement can spiral into endless debate. A third voice breaks ties.</p>

    <h2>Someone Has to Call It</h2>

    <p>Beyond one person, you need someone who decides. Not a dictator. Not someone who imposes their taste. Someone who can sense the <em>kairos</em> of each reflection.</p>

    <p>The moment when you've found the right solution. The moment when you're changing direction too often. The moment when you're digging deeper into the wrong hole.</p>

    <p>This person is also the guardian of quality. Sometimes through subjective remarks that are hard to articulate. "I don't know what's wrong, but something's off." That instinct matters. It catches problems that logic misses.</p>

    <p>The best design happens when this role exists but stays light. Not someone who overrides, but someone who notices when the group is stuck or drifting, and gently redirects.</p>

    <h2>The Shape of It</h2>

    <p>One is unstable. Two is ideal but fragile. Three or four, with the right trust, becomes resilient.</p>

    <p>The geometry of good design isn't about talent. It's about the structure that lets talent converge.</p>
