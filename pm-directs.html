    <h1>PM Directs, Dev Owns, Designer Polishes</h1>
    <p class="series-label">Notes on Building</p>

    <p>We're a team of six: four developers, one designer, one PM. Here's the flow we've landed on for shipping complex features quickly without chaos.</p>

    <p>The PM owns the roadmap and the sprint—what we should build and when. They draft a rough spec for each feature: the problem, the constraints, the intended outcome. This is direction, not prescription.</p>

    <p>Then each developer takes ownership of a feature. They don't just implement the spec—they refine it. They identify edge cases, propose solutions, push back on scope. They do their own wireframes. They define the logic, the data flow, the systems inherent to the feature.</p>

    <p>Only after careful validation and alignment with the PM does the work go to the designer. At this point, the wireframes exist, the logic is sound, the feature makes sense. The designer's job isn't to figure out what to build. It's to make what we're building feel right—polished, consistent, delightful.</p>

    <p>This sequence matters. When designers receive half-formed ideas directly from PMs, they waste cycles on wireframes that don't account for technical constraints. When developers receive polished designs without input, they build exactly what's drawn—even when they know a better approach.</p>

    <p>By giving developers ownership of the middle stage, you get faster iteration, fewer misalignments, and features that are both technically sound and visually refined.</p>
