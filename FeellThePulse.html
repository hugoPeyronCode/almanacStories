    <h1>Feel the Pulse</h1>
    <p class="series-label">Notes on Building</p>

    <p>We opened a WhatsApp group early so users could join directly. What we get is a self-selected mix: the super engaged and the super frustrated. Both tell you things analytics can't.</p>

    <p>So far, less than 1% of users have joined. That's enough. You don't need statistical significance when you're listening for signal, not measuring effect sizes.</p>

    <p>The group surfaces bugs that would otherwise stay invisible. Here's one: the entire dev team reinstalls the app constantly—testing, debugging, resetting state. We never experience what a long-term user experiences. A user in the group reported that after solving more than 1,000 puzzles, the app started lagging. FPS dropped noticeably.</p>

    <p>The cause was a memory leak that only manifested at scale. We would have found it eventually, maybe through a one-star review, maybe through churn we couldn't explain. Instead, we found it through someone who cared enough to tell us directly.</p>

    <p>This is what "feeling the pulse" means. Not dashboards. Not surveys. A channel where your most invested users can reach you, and where their frustration becomes your information advantage.</p>
